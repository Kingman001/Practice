    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining elements like text, images, and links. While not a programming language itself, HTML works in tandem with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive websites.</p><br/>
<p>Here's a more detailed explanation:</p>
<ul><li><span class="bold">Structure:</span><br/>
HTML uses tags to define different elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. These tags tell the browser how to display the content.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Content:</span><br/>
HTML allows you to include text, images, videos, and other media on your website.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Interactivity:</span><br/>
While HTML provides the structure, it's often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding dynamic behavior to the page.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Tags:</span><br/>
HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets to define elements. Some tags have closing tags, while others are self-closing.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Attributes:</span><br/>
Tags can also have attribute that provide additional information about the element.</li></ul>

<hr>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
</p>
<p>Example of a CSS code is: <br/><code>font-size: 4rem;</code></p>

  <section class="main-section" id="javascript">
<header>JavaScript</header>
<hr>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily known for its role in creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (for structuring content) and CSS (for styling content).</p>
<p>An example of a JavaScript code is: <br/><code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code></p>
<p>Key characteristics and uses of JavaScript:</p>
<ul><li><span class="bold">Client-side scripting:</span><br/>
Traditionally, JavaScript executes within web browsers, enabling features like interactive forms, animations, dynamic content updates, and user interface elements.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Server-side development:</span><br/>
With Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for backend development, building scalable network applications and APIs.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Full-fledged programming language:</span><br/>
JavaScript possesses standard programming constructs such as variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming capabilities (with prototypes and classes).</li>
<li><span class="bold">Versatility:</span><br/>
Beyond web development, JavaScript is utilized in various domains, including mobile app development (with frameworks like React Native), desktop applications (with Electron), and even game development.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Standardization:</span><br/>
JavaScript is standardized by Ecma International under the name ECMAScript, ensuring consistency across different implementations.</li></ul>

<p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language and computing platform. It's known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, allowing compiled Java code to execute on different platforms without recompilation. Java is widely used in enterprise software, mobile and web applications, and more.<br/> 
<p class="java-code">An example of a Java hello world code is:
<pre><code>
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</code></pre></p>
<p class="bold">Key aspects of Java:<br/>
<ul><li><span class="bold">Object-Oriented:</span><br/>
Java is fundamentally based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and methods.<br/>
<li><span class="bold">Platform Independence:</span><br/>
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows Java bytecode to run on any system with a JVM, regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware.<br/> 
<li><span class="bold">Wide Adoption:</span><br/>
Java powers a large number of applications and services across various platforms, from desktops and servers to mobile devices and embedded systems.<br/> 
<li><span class="bold">Strong Community and Ecosystem:</span><br/>
Java has a large and active community, providing ample resources, libraries, and frameworks for developers.</li></ul>
<span class="bold">Key Applications:</span>
<p>Java is used in diverse areas, including:</p>
<ol><li>Enterprise-level applications</li>
<li>Android mobile development</li>
<li>Web development (both front-end and back-end)</li>
<li>Big data processing</li>
<li>Cloud computing</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Internet of Things (IoT) devices</li></ol>
<p>In essence, Java is a powerful and reliable technology that continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development.

<p>Python is a high-level, versatile, and widely used programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's a popular choice for various applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a Python code:
<pre><code>
# This is a simple Python program
# It demonstrates printing output and using a variable

name = "Alice"
age = 30

print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")

# You can also perform simple calculations
result = 5 + 3
print(f"The sum of 5 and 3 is: {result}")
</code></pre></p>
<p>Here's a more detailed look at Python:</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ol><li><span class="bold">Readability:</span><br/>

<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and drone control.</p>
<p>PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
</p>
<p>This is a PHP code:
<pre><code>
  $name = "World";
  echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";
</code></pre>
